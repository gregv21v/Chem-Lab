# Chem-Lab


An idle game about mixing chemicals. <br>
Inspired by Minecraft's Buildcraft Mod

<strong>Objective:</strong>
Mix chemicals togther. Create a network of connecting pipes and tanks to seperate tanks individually to create higher value liquids to cell.



<strong> Items </strong>
- Valves                  --> Pipes that you can open and close
- Tank                    --> Stores liquid
- Pump                    --> Produces liquid
- Sell Tank               --> Allows you to sell liquids
- Liquid Distributor Pipe --> Distributes liquids evenly among connecting tanks
- Liquid Sorter Pipe      --> Sorts liquids by color



<strong> Mechanics </strong>
- A <b>store</b> where you can buy, and sell tanks, pipes, pumps, and whatever else I decide to add.
- An <b>inventory</b> where you store your items.
- A <b>playground</b> where you place you place items.
- The ability to sort various liquids, by chemical properties

  - there are some issues with the snapping mechanics
- Snap valves to the edge of tanks 
- Create the liquid distributor pipe
- Create the liquid sorter pipe
- Create a class for the sell tank
- Create the store interface
- Design the store interface
- Connect pipes together
