# Chem-Lab


An idle game about mixing chemicals. <br>
Inspired by Minecraft's Buildcraft Mod

<strong>Objective:</strong>
Mix chemicals together. Create a network of connecting pipes and tanks to separate tanks individually.

<strong> Items </strong>
- Valves                  --> Pipes that you can open and close
- Tank                    --> Stores liquid
- Pump                    --> Produces liquid
- Liquid Distributor Pipe --> Distributes liquids evenly among connecting tanks
- Liquid Sorter Pipe      --> Sorts liquids by color


<strong> Tools </strong>
- Sell Tool               --> Allows you to sell the contents of a tank


<strong> Mechanics </strong>
- A <b>shop</b> where you can buy and sell items.
- An <b>inventory</b> where you store your items.
- A <b>world</b> where you place your items.
- The ability to sort various liquids, by chemical properties
- Different chemicals that react in different ways when they are combined with each other.


<strong> TODO:</strong>
- Snap valves to the edge of tanks
- Create the liquid distributor pipe
- Create the liquid sorter pipe 
- Create a class for the sell tank (extra)
- Create the store interface (priority)
* Design the store interface
- Connect pipes together
- Overflow mechanic: tanks spill drops over the edges
  when they have been filled too much. (extra)
- Create snappable class that allows you to create generic snappable objects (extra)
- Display a miniturized graphic of the actual world object on the icons

- Create gases
- Create a home screen 
- Add the ability to move tanks

<strong>Where did I leave off?</strong>
Last time I was working on chemistry lab. I was working on reorganizing the structure of the classes.
