1) Keep things as simple as possible
2) When adding new features try not to change too much of the
  old code
3) Keep drawing functions seperate from the regular functions. Don't include 
  any graphics code in the constructor

Each Drawable Class has 3 things:
1) create() - initializes the graphics of this class
  - Each svg component of the class should have a name attribute assigned to it.
3) update() -  method that updates the graphics of this class
4) destroy() - method that removes the graphics for this class 


Classes should follow the following guidlines:

Imports go below the class comment and above the 
class declaration

Method order:
constructor()

create()
destroy()

---everything else---

getters & setters 



-------------Commenting------------------
All method comments should look like this:
/**
  * methodName()
  * @description description...
  * list of parameter 
  * returns if necessary
  */


All class comments should look like this
/**
 * ClassName - description of class
 */

All code should be properly indented
